I am Ikegbunam Michael Kolade, and my life has been a journey marked by inquisitiveness, fervor, and a relentless pursuit of diverse experiences. My journey began on October 8th, 1999, in the vibrant city of Lagos, Nigeria. Over the years, I've ventured through the corridors of education, delved into the world of physiotherapy, and currently, I'm on the path of software development. <br>

My early education commenced at Nubi Private School, where I was first introduced to the wonders of the world. This early exposure ignited a natural curiosity within me, setting the foundation for a lifelong quest for knowledge. My educational journey continued at Adeyemi College of Education Demonstration Secondary School in Ondo, where I honed my skills and nurtured a deep commitment to learning. <br>

The turning point in my academic voyage occurred at Nnamdi Azikiwe University, Awka. It was there that I wholeheartedly embraced the field of physiotherapy, dedicating years of unwavering effort and diligence to eventually earn a degree in physiotherapy. <br> This achievement stands as a testament to my resilience and my enduring passion for the sciences. <br>

In my personal life, I've remained steadfast and single, affording me the freedom to explore an array of diverse interests. I discovered both solace and challenge on the basketball court, where I pushed the boundaries of my physical and mental limits. Beyond the court, I embarked on an exhilarating journey into the realm of cryptocurrency, navigating the uncharted waters of the digital market with analytical precision and strategic insight. <br>

This is my ongoing narrative, a story with many chapters yet to be writtenâ€”a tale of a curious mind, a compassionate heart, and a life brimming with multifaceted pursuits. <br>

            My primary goal in enrolling at AltSchool is to acquire the
            necessary skills in frameworks, programming languages, and tools to
            advance in the tech industry. My secondary goal is to build an
            extensive portfolio of projects that will showcase my abilities and
            problem-solving skills to prospective employers. My third goal is to
            establish a network of connections with instructors and fellow
            students, as networking can provide opportunities for future
            success.
